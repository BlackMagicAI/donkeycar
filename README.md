Donkeycar is minimalist and modular self driving library for Python. It is
developed for hobbyists and students with a focus on allowing fast experimentation and easy
community contributions.

#### Use Quasiboto Donkey if you want to:
* Make an RC car drive its self.
* Compete in self driving races like [DIY Robocars](http://diyrobocars.com)
* Experiment with autopilots, mapping computer vision and neural networks.
* Log sensor data. (images, user inputs, sensor readings)
* Drive your car via a web or game controller.
* Leverage community contributed driving data.
* Use existing CAD models for design upgrades.

### Get driving.
After building a Quasiboto robot you can turn on your car and go to http://localhost:8887 to drive.

### Modify your cars behavior.
Quasiboto is controlled by running a sequence of events

### Setup and Driving info
Quasiboto setup is the same as for the original donkeycar but the steps are repeated here.
1. Step1
2. Step2
3. Step3
4. Step4
5. Step5
